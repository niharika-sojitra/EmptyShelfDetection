# EmptyShelfDetection

This is a project work for Course "Computer Vision" Under Dr. Bajwa with final report of the findings.

**Abstract**

Out of Stock detection (OOS) has the key role to improve on-shelf availability of products in the supermarket. This project proposes a system that actively detects empty spaces from densely packed racks in retail stores. We approached a currently used method of Object detection in which the features of an image is outlined by bounding box. In contrast, our proposed method of image segmentation that robustly detects the voids as the Region of Interest (RoI) which is the input to the machine learning model. The outcome of this model is the mask that indicates whether the void is present or not.
